Q: How ready is stargate for production workloads
A: Stargate we are still alpha and expect to be for some time, we need with feedback

Q: Stargate doesn't let me tweak a setting that I want
A: File a GitHub issue, but we're trying ot keep this simple to use with strong opinions about best practices. This is all about a quick ramp and the 
views that are generated by Stargate are queryable without Stargate.

Q: Stargate isn't managing my schema!
A: We are waiting on Apache Cassandra to have [strongly consistent schema](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-10699) before we solve this.
